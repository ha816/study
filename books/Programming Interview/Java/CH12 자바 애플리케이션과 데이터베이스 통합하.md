> ACID?
> In computer science, **ACID** (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is a set of properties of database transaction intended to guarantee validity even in the event of errors, power failures, etc.

* Isolation is the main goal of concurrency control Transactions are often executed concurrently.(e.g., multiple transactions reading and writing to a table at the same time). [Isolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_(database_systems) "Isolation (database systems)") ensures that concurrent execution of transactions leaves the database in the same state that would have been obtained if the transactions were executed sequentially.
* Durability guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain committed even in the case of a system failure (e.g., power outage or crash. This usually means that completed transactions (or their effects) are recorded in non-volatile memory
