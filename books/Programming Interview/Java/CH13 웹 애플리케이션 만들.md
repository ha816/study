# 톰캣과 서블릿 API

톰캣과 제티는 둘자 자바 서블릿 API를 구현한다. 
 
API
: Application Programming Interface. In basic terms, APIs just allow applications to communicate with one another. When people speak of “an API”, they sometimes generalize and actually mean “a publicly available web-based API that returns data, likely in JSON or XML”.  The API is not the database or even the server, it is the code that governs the _access point(s)_ for the server.
