## Organization of This Book

Chapter 2 introduces the basic terminology(용어, 단어) and concepts behind statistical learning. This chapter also presents the K-nearest neighbor classifier, a very simple method that works surprisingly well on many problems. Chapters 3 and 4 cover classical linear methods for regression and classification. In particular, Chapter 3 reviews linear regression, the fundamental start- ing point for all regression methods. In Chapter 4 we discuss two of the most important classical classification methods, logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis.

A central problem in all statistical learning situations involves choosing the best method for a given application. Hence, in Chapter 5 we introduce cross-validation and the bootstrap, which can be used to estimate the accuracy of a number of different methods in order to choose the best one.

Much of the recent research in statistical learning has concentrated on non-linear methods. However, linear methods often have advantages over their non-linear competitors in terms of interpretability and sometimes also accuracy. Hence, in Chapter 6 we consider a host of linear methods, both classical and more modern, which offer potential improvements over standard linear regression. These include stepwise selection, ridge regression, principal components regression, partial least squares, and the lasso(올가미밧줄).

The remaining chapters move into the world of non-linear statistical learning. We first introduce in Chapter 7 a number of non-linear methods that work well for problems with a single input variable. We then show how these methods can be used to fit non-linear additive models for which there is more than one input. In Chapter 8, we investigate tree-based methods, including bagging, boosting, and random forests. Support vector machines, a set of approaches for performing both linear and non-linear classification are discussed in Chapter 9. Finally, in Chapter 10, we consider a setting in which we have input variables but no output variable. In particular, we present principal components analysis, K-means clustering, and hierarchical clustering.

At the end of each chapter, we present one or more R lab sections in which we systematically work through applications of the various meth- ods discussed in that chapter. These labs demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of the various approaches, and also provide a useful reference for the syntax required to implement the various methods. The reader may choose to work through the labs at his or her own pace, or the labs may be the focus of group sessions as part of a classroom environment. Within each R lab, we present the results that we obtained when we performed the lab at the time of writing this book. However, new versions of R are continuously released, and over time, the packages called in the labs will be updated. Therefore, in the future, it is possible that the results shown in the lab sections may no longer correspond precisely to the results obtained by the reader who performs the labs. As necessary, we will post updates to the labs on the book website.
