# Weka

Weka is a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks. The algorithms can either be applied directly to a dataset or called from your own Java code. 

Weka contains tools for **data pre-processing, classification, regression, clustering, association rules, and visualization.** It is also well-suited for developing new machine learning schemes.
