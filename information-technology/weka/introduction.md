# Weka

Weka is a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks. The algorithms can either be applied directly to a dataset or called from your own Java code. 

Weka contains tools for **data pre-processing, classification, regression, clustering, association rules, and visualization.** It is also well-suited for developing new machine learning schemes.

# Datasets

Each entry in a dataset is an instance of the java class
That is, weka.core.Instance

Each weka.core.instance consists of a number of attributes

## Attributes

Nominal
: one of a predefined list of values − e.g. red, green, blue 

Numeric
: A real or integer number

String
: Enclosed in “double quotes”

Date
    Relational
